This starter kit is here to easily start a repository for your students.

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional tools to validate code standards.

- GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :

  - PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR2
  - PHPStan will check PHP recommendation

  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

- Travis CI, as Continuous Integration will be run when a branch with active pull request is updated on github. It will run :

  - Tasks to check if vendor, .idea, env.local are not versionned,
  - PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR2,
  - PHPStan will check PHP recommendation.
